    question: "4. Is leasing or Vario-leasing right for me?",
    answer:
      "At the conclusion of your contract term, you have the flexibility to either return the vehicle or purchase it outright. This decision can be made flexibly before the return date. Our Vario leasing option allows you to secure a guaranteed purchase price in advance, giving you the opportunity to own the car at the end of the term. However, if you change your mind, there's no need to worry. You can simply return the vehicle, and we'll handle its resale in the used car market.This innovative financing method provides you with planning security, a flexible purchase option, and a guaranteed purchase price. If you prefer to use a new car without the commitment of ownership, our mileage leasing option might be the perfect solution for you. While this option doesn't include a guaranteed purchase price like Vario leasing does, it offers more flexibility in terms of contract duration and mileage. You can choose terms starting from as short as 12 months and select annual mileage options of up to 45,000 km.",
